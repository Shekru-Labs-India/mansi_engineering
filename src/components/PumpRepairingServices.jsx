                Rebaring, also known as reinforcing steel, is the process of adding steel bars or meshes within concrete structures to provide additional tensile strength. Concrete, on its own, is excellent in compression but weak in tension. By strategically placing reinforcing bars, the load-carrying capacity of the concrete is greatly improved, making it capable of withstanding various external forces and environmental factors.
