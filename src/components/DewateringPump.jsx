                        Understanding Dewatering Pumps
                        The purpose of a dewatering pump is to remove water, sludge, and other liquids from various locations. They operate by creating a low-pressure area that draws water into the pump and then expels it through an outlet pipe. These pumps are engineered to handle clear and muddy water, making them suitable for various applications.
